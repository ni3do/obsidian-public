# Eigendecomposition
- Is the factorization of the matrix whereby it gets represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- special case of [[3-ressources/math/linear-algebra/singular-value-decomposition\|SVD]]

## Definition
$$A = Q \Lambda Q^{-1}$$
$A$ square $n\times n$ with $n$ linearly indep. eigenvectors $q_i$ and $\Lambda_{ii}$ corresponds to the eigenvalue of $q_i$
