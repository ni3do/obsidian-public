Plex Media Server is a powerful media organization and streaming platform. It allows users to centralize their media collection, including movies, TV shows, music, and photos, on a computer or network-attached storage (NAS) device. Plex then indexes and organizes the media, providing an intuitive interface for users to access and stream their content across various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and streaming devices. With features like on-the-fly transcoding, remote access, and robust media management, Plex makes it easy to enjoy your media library anytime, anywhere.
