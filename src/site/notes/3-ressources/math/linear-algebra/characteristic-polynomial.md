# Characteristic Polynomial
* Works with square matrices
* it has the [[3-ressources/math/linear-algebra/eigenvalue\|eigenvalues]] as roots

## Definition
Consider $n \times n$ matrix $A$ the characteristic polynomial is:
$$p_{A}(\lambda) = \text{det}(\lambda I-A)$$
where $\lambda$ is an [[3-ressources/math/linear-algebra/eigenvalue\|eigenvalue]] of $A$
